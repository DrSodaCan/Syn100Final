    "description": "September 2024 | Location: Laurel Canyon, LA. | This piece is made by Jonathan Martinez. Martinez grew up in urban Los Angeles. Due to his upbringing he recounted how he was not exposed to the vibrant nature of California that exists outside of the city. To help remedy this issue for the next generation, he started in 2010 to make public mural artists of endangered species and native species. Urban dwellers will see these species threatened by climate change and feel more connected to them thus inspiring civic duty.  This art piece specifically depicts native wildlife from LA and his intention in doing so is to push back against the idea of LA being a concrete jungle devoid of nature. As well, his use of brighter colors adds a more hopeful tone to the idea of protecting these native species while the seamless blending of his paints emphasizes the idea of unity among the different environments in LA (the poppy fields, mountains, ocean).",

    "description": "1994 | Museum of New Zealand | This piece is made by Michel Tuffery. Tuffery is a Polynesian artist born in New Zealand who often draws upon their Pacific Islander heritage in their art as they address issues their people have historically faced and new issues that they face in the present day. 'This piece depicts a bull made of corned beef cans. When New Zealand was colonized in 1840 they were forced to be the cattle farm for Britain. The diverting of streams for agriculture, the clearing of native forests, and the introduction of invasive cows devastated the biodiversity of New Zealand. This piece shows that colonization not only damages native populations in various ways (a focus of this piece is making natives dependent on unhealthy corned beef) but it also shows how colonization can decimate an environmentâ€™s biodiversity which is crucial to not only prevent climate change but respond to it.'",
