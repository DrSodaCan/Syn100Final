    "description": "September 2024 | Location: Laurel Canyon, LA. | This piece is made by Jonathan Martinez. Martinez grew up in urban Los Angeles. Due to his upbringing he recounted how he was not exposed to the vibrant nature of California that exists outside of the city. To help remedy this issue for the next generation, he started in 2010 to make public mural artists of endangered species and native species. Urban dwellers will see these species threatened by climate change and feel more connected to them thus inspiring civic duty.  This art piece specifically depicts native wildlife from LA and his intention in doing so is to push back against the idea of LA being a concrete jungle devoid of nature. As well, his use of brighter colors adds a more hopeful tone to the idea of protecting these native species while the seamless blending of his paints emphasizes the idea of unity among the different environments in LA (the poppy fields, mountains, ocean).",

    "description": "1994 | Museum of New Zealand | This piece is made by Michel Tuffery. Tuffery is a Polynesian artist born in New Zealand who often draws upon their Pacific Islander heritage in their art as they address issues their people have historically faced and new issues that they face in the present day. 'This piece depicts a bull made of corned beef cans. When New Zealand was colonized in 1840 they were forced to be the cattle farm for Britain. The diverting of streams for agriculture, the clearing of native forests, and the introduction of invasive cows devastated the biodiversity of New Zealand. This piece shows that colonization not only damages native populations in various ways (a focus of this piece is making natives dependent on unhealthy corned beef) but it also shows how colonization can decimate an environment’s biodiversity which is crucial to not only prevent climate change but respond to it.'",

    "description": "This piece is made by Robert Smithson. Smithson’s work focused on a wide range of environmental topics from mineralogy to climate change. However a large portion of his works focused on the fragility of ecosystems.This piece is a large spiral jetty in the Great Salt Lake. Smithson made the piece in 1970 to commemorate the celebration of the First Earth Day. It is composed of volcanic rock, mud, and sand all from the local environment. The lake itself is a terminating body of water meaning that only water flows into it and no water flows out. Due to that the lake’s water level shows if the environment is in a drought. If the water level is high then the jetty may not be visible at all. This interactive element of the art is not only fun but adequately communicates to the surrounding community if the Great Salt Lake is shrinking due to climate change.",

    "description": "This landscape piece is made by the famous Chinese landscape artist Fan Kuan. Fan Kuan was previously a political figure who became a recluse following political turmoil.[This piece depicts a landscape from the Shaanxi province in China. While many Chinese landscape paintings opted to depict vague shrubbery and crablike trees, Fan Kuan depicts native cypress and pine from the environment. His choice to make the landscape vertical rather than horizontal like a traditional landscape serves to make the mountains larger and presents the theme of the power and authority of nature. Similarly his choice to depict the travelers next to the stream as miniscule promotes this idea that humans exist within the context of nature rather than existing independently of nature. Although this painting was made 1000 years before climate change was a concern, adopting this thought process of our lives existing within the context of nature will go a great way in promoting climate change action.]",

    "description": "German artist Casper David Friedrich is known for his pieces which are an intensive exploration of humanity and their relationship with nature. His art pieces are especially powerful in the present day as humanity struggles with their troubled relationship with the environment with the ongoing climate change crisis. This art piece demonstrates the sublime power of nature and man’s relation to it. The figure in the painting is having a moment of reflection after climbing above the fog  in the painting which can represent confusion. A similar theme seen throughout Freiedrich’s paintings is the idea of how insignificant man is compared to nature. Although the man is the focus of the painting we see how small and unimportant he is compared to the rolling mountains, towering forests, and piercing spires of rocks.",

    "description": "Thomas Cole is the founder of the Hudson River School of art which is one of the first tentative schools of painting in the United States. Cole tends to showcase the environments in his landscapes through a very nationalistic perspective as seen in this piece.<br>Cole’s piece demonstrates the American idealization of manifest destiny. On one side of the art piece is a serene environment of farms and civilization painted in lighter yellows and with a sunny sky. The other side of the painting is a twisted thicket with darker colors, more shadowing, and a stormy sky above. This contrast demonstrates the American idea of manifest destiny as humanity’s duty to civilize untamed nature. As well to further this idea nature is villainized in this piece as dangerous and mysterious. Such an outlook on nature as seen in this piece has enabled the U.S to find the destruction of nature as not only morally permissible, but as a moral duty. As a result of this loss of biodiversity and this othering of nature we are now facing a climate change crisis.",

    "name": "Haitian Landscape",
    "coords": [38.8928, -77.0415],
    "description": "The artist Joseph Jean-Gilles was born in Haiti and is a self-taught painter. Although his style has often been criticized for appearing primitive, he found great success in the American art scene through his art’s usage of two-dimensional rendering and brilliant color. This painting depicts an idyllic Haitian landscape with bright colors and a smooth application of paint. Such a bright cheery painting is out of the norm of traditional Haitian folk paintings which often depict Haitian history or cultural practices. The figures in the painting and their houses live together within the context of nature. There are houses dotted throughout the landscape, and the farms in the landscape are incorporated into the environment itself. Although such a Haitian landscape is unlikely to be found today this painting holds a sense of nostalgia for a time when humans and nature lived harmoniously. This painting’s focus on nostalgia of how Haitian landscapes looked in the past raises questions of how western influences reshape the environment and culture of developing countries and how this forceful change contributes to the urgency of the climate crisis.",

She works “at the intersection of climate justice and cultural awareness” and incorporates Cherokee mythology into her work, “[hoping] to illuminate awareness about our shifting cultural climate and to inspire solutions to the social and environmental issues of today. “Coyotes began to call out as the sun started to set. Through their calls, I listened to their messages — messages that sounded like ancient code being spoken in Coyote. Messages about how to move forward in balance, how to guide my children through this strange time, and how to simply survive. I was reminded that we have been through this before, but that we must listen and learn from our past. Not only did our human survival depend on it, but the Earth did as well.”",
